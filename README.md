# Supplemental Code for "How Genotype-by-Environment Interactions Maintain Variation in Mutualisms" 

## Streamlined Analysis.nb
This file provides a quick and digestible version of the mathematical analysis of our model. 

## GXE Symmetric Dispersal.nb
Comprehensive Mathematica notebook containing full analysis of our model when dispersal is symmetric along with numerical simulations. 


## GXE Asymmetric Dispersal.nb
Comprehensive Mathematica notebook containing full analysis of our model when dispersal is asymmetric along with numerical simulations. 

## GXE Asymmetric Payoffs.nb
Mathematica notebook containing simulations using a version of our model with asymmetric payoffs between genotypes and environments and parameters from [Johnson et al. 2010](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0906710107). 

## nuismer.nb
Mathematica notebook containing a brief supplemental analysis contining the same assumptions as the model from Nuismer 2017, chapter 7. 

## GXE Reaction Norms.py
Python file containing code used to generate reaction norm plots using data from [Johnson et al. 2010](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0906710107), [Ricks et al. 2023](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/725393), and [Henry et al. 2020](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.21.306779v4). This code also contains statistical analysis of pairwise differences in [Johnson et al. 2010](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0906710107). 

## Data.zip
This file contains all data used in our project from [Johnson et al. 2010](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0906710107), [Ricks et al. 2023](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/725393), and [Henry et al. 2020](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.21.306779v4). It contains a separate Readme.txt file that describes each file from these studies. It also contains code used to analyze data by Ricks et al. and Henry et al. that we reference in our manuscript. Full details on this statistical analysis can be found in each of these publications respectively. We used the data from Johnson et al. to conduct our own statistical analysis.
