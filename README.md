## Streamlined Analysis.nb
This file provides a quick and digestible version of the mathematical analysis of our model. 

## GXE Symmetric Dispersal.nb
Comprehensive Mathematica notebook containing full analysis of our model when dispersal is symmetric along with numerical simulations. 


## GXE Asymmetric Dispersal.nb
Comprehensive Mathematica notebook containing full analysis of our model when dispersal is asymmetric along with numerical simulations. 

## GXE Asymmetric Payoffs.nb
Mathematica notebook containing simulations using a version of our model with asymmetric payoffs between genotypes and environments and parameters from [Johnson et al. 2010](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0906710107)
