# Supplemental Code for "How Genotype-by-Environment Interactions Maintain Variation in Mutualisms" 

## Streamlined Analysis.nb
This file provides a quick and digestible version of the mathematical analysis of our model. 

## GXE Symmetric Dispersal.nb
Comprehensive Mathematica notebook containing full analysis of our model when dispersal is symmetric along with numerical simulations. 


## GXE Asymmetric Dispersal.nb
Comprehensive Mathematica notebook containing full analysis of our model when dispersal is asymmetric along with numerical simulations. 

## GXE Asymmetric Payoffs.nb
Mathematica notebook containing simulations using a version of our model with asymmetric payoffs between genotypes and environments and parameters from [Johnson et al. 2010](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0906710107). 

## nuismer.nb
Mathematica notebook containing a brief supplemental analysis contining the same assumptions as the model from Nuismer 2017, chapter 8. 

## GXE Reaction Norms.py
Python file containing code used to generate reaction norm plots using data from [Johnson et al. 2010](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0906710107), [Ricks et al. 2023](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/725393), and [Henry et al. 2020](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.21.306779v4).
